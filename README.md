# Hi there!!
 
In these process we are creating a program that reads the value of two sides of a right triangle and indicates the value of the hypotenuse!

### Just to remember!

## What is the Pythagorean Theorem? 

The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of the squared sides of a right triangle equals the length of the hypotenuse squared.

You might recognize this theorem in the form of the Pythagorean equation: a 2 + b 2 = c 2.

# We are using the program Dev C++

## I hope you enjoy!
